    <p class="para dana">Piperki polneti or stuffed peppers, are also very popular dish in Macedonia. Peppers are stuffed with ground meat with rice and spices then baked in the oven. The important thing about baking is that you need to keep them moisture all the time, you don't want them to turn out dry or with uncooked grains of rice, right?</p>
    <p class="para">Another awesome thing about stuffed peppers are the peppers you use. We're blessed here in Macedonia to have the best peppers in the world, those who've tried Macedonian peppers know what I mean.

    <h1>Macedonian AJvar</h1>
    <img src="ajvar.jpg" alt="Macedonian Ajvar">
    <p>–êjvar is a the favorite Macedonian traditional peppers dish which marks the beginning of fall/winter season. It's a spread made of red peppers, but not any red peppers, but the Macedonian variety of red peppers named "ajvarka". </p>
    <p>Ajvar is known as an ideal companion to cold winters, it's a food that has no adequate replacement, and in combination with cheese, it creates irreplaceable and unique pleasure in your mouth. Similar to ajvar (which I call them ajvar's brothers) are malidzano and lutenica, also very popular products from Macedonia.</p>

        <li>How to know if ajvar is ready? While stirring, if your big spoon leaves a trail at the bottom so you can see the bottom of the pot, then, you know that ajvar is ready. Overall cooking time should be around 90 minutes.</li>
        <li>Prepare the jars while ajvar is still cooking. Heat them in an oven at 50 C degrees. Fill jars with ajvar after removing from heat. Jars should be hot and ajvar should be also hot. Close well the lids. Keep jars in a dark place.</li>
